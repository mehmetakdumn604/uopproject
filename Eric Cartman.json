    "desc": "Eric Theodore Cartman, often referred to just by his surname,[1] is the main character in the adult animated television series South Park, created by Matt Stone and Trey Parker, and is voiced by Parker. He is one of the series' four central characters, along with Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and Kenny McCormick, though he is considered the main character of the show. A prototypical version of Cartman (called Kenny) first appeared in the 1992 animated short, Jesus vs. Frosty, later appearing in the 1995 animated short Jesus vs. Santa, and first appeared on television in the pilot episode of South Park, 'Cartman Gets an Anal Probe', on August 13, 1997.Cartman is an elementary school student who lives with his mother in the fictional town of South Park, Colorado, where he routinely has extraordinary experiences atypical of a small town. Cartman is aggressive, savage, prejudiced, arrogant and narcissistic since his character's inception, being described by Stone and Parker as 'a little Archie Bunker'. In later seasons, Cartman begins to exhibit extremely psychopathic, sociopathic and manipulative behavior, particularly in episodes such as 'Scott Tenorman Must Die' and also is highly intelligent, able to execute morally appalling plans and business ideas with success, but most of them usually end up in failure and humiliation due to someone (usually either Stan or Kyle, or both) or something (e.g. a myrrh record award, rather than a platinum record award, in 'Christian Rock Hard') that ruins his schemes.Cartman is considered by prominent publications and television channels to be the most popular and famous character on South Park, one of the most influential characters in cartoon and television history, and an American cultural icon.[2][3][4] Parker and Stone state that he is their favorite character, and the one with whom they most identify. South Park has received both praise and criticism for Cartman's politically incorrect behavior.",
